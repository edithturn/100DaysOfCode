# 100 Days Of Code

This is a repository for the work I have done for the 100DaysToCode using Python


## Python Web Application

```bash
cd my-project/
git init
heroku git:remote -a python04-test
git add .
git commit -am "make it better"
git push heroku master
heroku open
```

# Classes and Objects
The name of the class have to have the first letter capitalize: "PascalCase"
camelCase: just the first word is lowe case
skae_case: all words separate with underscore in lower case.
